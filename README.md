# Java
Some of my Java work

This work was done in my beginner and more intermediate stages of learning Java. These are personal projects that I worked on for fun. They also helped me familiarize myself with the syntax and logic of a certain chapter I was studying. Some are also class assignments.They all compile and run. I would love to go over them again one day to make them better, cleaner, more modularized, and more efficient. The best way to learn and become a better programmer is to simply give it a go and practie coding. That was my plan here. I improve every time I code. It takes time and patience!
