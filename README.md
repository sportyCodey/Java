Some of my Java work

I have taken Programming 2 and Data Structures in Java. I plan on taking Advanced Java Programming in the Fall 2018. Java is my favorite programming language and the one I'm most comfortable in. As of now, I'm reviewing Java syntax, fine-tuning my knowledge on the theory, and self-teaching myself concepts we never discussed in class.

The work shown was done in my beginner and intermediate stages of learning Java. Every program is a solution to problems taken from Introduction to Java Programming Comprehensive Version 10th Edition by Liang. These programs were used to help me familiarize myself with the syntax and logic of a certain chapter I was studying, or they were simply classroom assignments that I had to do.

I would love to go over them again one day to make them better, cleaner, more modularized, and more efficient. I would also love go over them again to document my code better. The best way to learn and become a better programmer is to simply give it a go and practie coding. That was my plan here (other than the code I had to do for a grade in class). I improve every time I code. It takes time, hard work, and patience!

I'm getting feedback from professionals that I need to "kick it up a notch" from programming problems in texbooks. So, this Spring and Summer I'll be working on larger personal projects in Java that will be my own ideas. I also plan on contributing to open source software in Java and other languages once I learn more about Git and am more comfortable with GitHub. I will also participate in programming contests like Kattis that will improve my programming in regards to strategy and algorithmic problems.
