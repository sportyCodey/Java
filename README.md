Some of my work in Java

Before I get into the details, here's a quick run down of each folder posted:

Solutions to problems in the Data Structures class I took:
Beetle,
Cram,
IdiotsDelight,
LinkedWar,
QuickSort,
Traversal
*********************************************************

Solutions to some practice exercises in the Programming 2 class I took and from self-study:
Exercise_Problems1,
Exercise_Problems2,
(Please note the problems are in no specific order)
*********************************************************

Java OpenGL (JOGL) programs I've worked on for fun. These are also solutions from a textbook:
Java OpenGL
*********************************************************

Some of the programs need text files and images posted in these folders:
Text&BinaryFiles,
card,
image
*********************************************************

Games I made (please check the Issues page about my games):

I have taken Programming 2 and Data Structures in Java. I plan on taking Advanced Java Programming in the Fall 2018. Java is my favorite programming language and the one I'm most comfortable in. As of now, I'm reviewing Java syntax, fine-tuning my knowledge on the theory, and self-teaching myself concepts we never discussed in class.

The work shown was done in my beginner and intermediate stages of learning Java. The Exercise_Problems1 and 2 are solutions to some problems taken from Introduction to Java Programming Comprehensive Version 10th Edition by Liang. These programs were used to help me familiarize myself with the syntax and logic of a certain chapter I was studying, or they were simply classroom assignments that I had to do. Very few programs posted are the authors work, but I include them here because I use them in other programs to give a solution to a problem in the book (E.g. add more functionality, create a child, use the class for my benefit, manipulate the class, change the inner workings, etc). The folders Beetle -> Traversal are mostly console video games from my Data Structures class.

In order to run the JOGL programs, you must ensure your graphics card supports at least version 4.3 of OpenGL, install JOGL, and install graphicslib3D.

I would love to go over them again one day to make them better, cleaner, more modularized, and more efficient. I would also love go over them again to document my code better. The best way to learn and become a better programmer is to simply give it a go and practie coding. That was my plan here (other than the code I had to do for a grade in class). I improve every time I code. It takes time, hard work, and patience!

I'm getting feedback from professionals that I need to "kick it up a notch" from programming problems in texbooks. So, this Spring and Summer I'll be working on larger personal projects in Java and other languages that will be my own ideas. I also plan on contributing to open source software in Java and other languages once I learn more about Git and am more comfortable with GitHub. I will also participate in programming contests like Kattis that will improve my programming in regards to strategy and algorithmic problems.
