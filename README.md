# Java
Some of my Java work

I have taken Programming 2 and Data Structures in Java. I plan on taking Advanced Java Programming in the Fall 2018. Java is my favorite programming language and the one I'm most comfortable in. As of now, I'm reviewing Java syntax and theory. I'm also working on larger personal projects in Java, and I plan on contributing to open source software in Java once I learn more about Git and am more comfortable with GitHub.

This work was done in my beginner and more intermediate stages of learning Java. Some are personal projects while others are class assignments. The personal projects were for experience and to help me familiarize myself with the syntax and logic of a certain chapter I was studying. They all compile and run. I would love to go over them again one day to make them better, cleaner, more modularized, and more efficient. I would also love go over them again to document my code better. The best way to learn and become a better programmer is to simply give it a go and practie coding. That was my plan here (other than the code I had to do for a grade in class). I improve every time I code. It takes time, hard work, and patience!
